Navigating the app.

You start with a list of pre-made boards. You can click on each board to see which lists are in each board. You can click on the buttons in the top right or bottom right corners to delete or edit the board respectively. You can also scroll down to add a new board with a name, description and an url to an image. You can leave out these details to just get pre-set title and description with no image.

Once you've navigated into a board, you can select a pre-made list and see the included tasks for each list. You can also create a new list and choose a name, description and colour.

Each task in a list can be marked as completed, deleted or edited. Each list can be edited or deleted as well.

You can use the back button in the top left corner of the app to go back to previous pages and versions of the app.
